## Abstract
This disclosure is directed to systems and methods for detecting and estimating motion of a head of a patient in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The system includes a pad for supporting a patient's head. The pad has protrusions and each of the protrusions define a chamber filed with a fluid. The system includes pressure sensors and each of the pressure sensors are operatively connected with a respective chamber. Each of the pressure sensors can sense a pressure within each of the respective chambers. The system includes a controller. The controller can receive data indicative of the pressure within each of the respective chambers, and can detect the motion of the head of the patient based on the data indicative of the pressure within each of the respective chambers.
