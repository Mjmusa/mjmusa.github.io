## Abstract
An exemplary robotic needle insertion system is disclosed that can provide respiration compensated needle insertion for an accurate and efficient ablation, biopsy, draining placement of a needle, among other surgical procedures. The system employs a robotic instrument comprising (i) a needle insertion mechanism configured to deliver the needle insertion in a step-wise manner that mimics the current clinical practice by inserting the needle (e.g., RFA needle) according to respiration and other motion and (ii) a probe manipulation mechanism to direct an ultrasound probe to provide intraoperative image guidance for the needle insertion. The robotic instrument includes a multi-degrees of freedom (DoF) motion control and actuator to provide for the accurate targeting of the needle at any workspace location.
