For my final project in the course BMEG 5213 Tissue Mechanics, viscoelastic tissue modeling was used to develop a tool-tissue interaction model capable of predicting the forces acting on a needle is inserted into tissue. The model was compared to both a phantom experiment and ex-vivo porcine liver experiment.
