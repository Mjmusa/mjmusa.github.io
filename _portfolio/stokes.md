This summer I worked as a **Robotics Engineering Intern** on the Development Team for Stokes Robotics, a company specializing in advanced robotics solutions and custom robotic systems for various industries. I primarily focused on secondary development of the Unitree line of quadrupedal robots, namely the Go2 and the B2. 

I contributed to the design of a custom backpack for the robot, which houses additional computers and sensors including RGB-D cameras and thermal imaging, enhancing the capabilities of the robot for complex tasks to meet customer needs. I also played a key role in the integration of our system with the onboard sensors of the robot, such as the LiDARs, to enable mapping and autonomous navigation of the robot.
