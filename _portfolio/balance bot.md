This work places significant emphasis on the implementation of advanced control strategies, encompassing adaptive control and reinforcement learning, to effectively manage uncertainties stemming from variations in parameters like mass, friction, and center of gravity. The development of a modular self-balancing robot attempts to highlight the significance of modularity and adaptability in the design of robotic systems that must operate in dynamic and uncertain conditions.

**This ongoing project will be the focus of my PhD dissertation.**
