## University of Arkansas, Department of Mechanical Engineering
### MEEG 3223 - Intro to Mechatronics
This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the principles governing the design and control of
mechatronic systems, necessitating the harmonization of mechanical and electrical expertise within a
cohesive framework. Key subject areas encompass foundational electronics, diode and transistor
functionalities, power amplification, digital logic, operational amplifier utilization, motor design, encoder
implementation, and Arduino programming.

I assisted in the development of the laboratory section of the course by designing Arduino based lab
activities, converted hand-written lecture notes to LATEX-based presentations, and validated sample
problems to be used in homework, quizzes, and examinations.
